üåê 1. Cloud Data Fusion
It will create an instance 
What it is:
Cloud Data Fusion helps you move, clean, combine, and load data from one place to another easily
A fully managed, GUI-based data integration tool built on CDAP (Cask Data Application Platform). Think of it as a drag-and-drop ETL/ELT platform.
Runs the pipeline to process and move the data
Monitors pipeline execution and gives logs
Use cases:

Building ETL pipelines without writing much code.

Ingesting data from multiple sources (on-prem, SaaS, GCS, BigQuery, etc.).

Data wrangling, cleansing, and transformation for analytics.

Ideal for business analysts or data engineers who prefer low-code/no-code tools.

Migrating legacy ETL jobs to GCP with minimal re-coding.

Example:
Ingesting data from an on-premise Oracle DB, transforming it, and loading it into BigQuery using a visual pipeline.

üåÄ 2. Cloud Dataflow
What it is:
A fully managed stream and batch data processing service. It's based on Apache Beam, and supports high-scale, real-time and batch processing.

Use cases:

Real-time analytics: e.g., processing clickstream or sensor data.

ETL pipelines that require complex transformations, windowing, joins, aggregations.

Data enrichment and cleaning on the fly.

Feeding ML models with live streaming data.

Example:
Streaming real-time purchase data from Pub/Sub, transforming it with Beam, and pushing it to BigQuery for dashboarding.

üï∏Ô∏è 3. Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow)
What it is:
A fully managed workflow orchestration tool based on Apache Airflow.

Use cases:

Orchestrating workflows that span multiple GCP services (BigQuery, Dataflow, GCS, etc.).

Running and scheduling complex DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) of tasks.

Coordinating ETL jobs, ML pipelines, or reporting workflows.

Handling dependency management, retries, and scheduling logic.

Example:
A DAG that:

Triggers a Cloud Dataflow job to process data.

Waits for completion.
